character (instructor): Well done on making it this far. To be honest I didn't quite expect you to take that long to complete it, but oh well.
character: Anyway, this is the LUMON Sanitation HQ. Everything that you will need for completing Job orders is here.
character: To your left is the Onboarding Simulation. You are welcome to try it again, just in case you needed a refresher (seems like you might...)
character: To your right is the employment reward terminal. This is where you submit upgrades for your suit after collecting multiversal resources.
character: Further to your right is the experimentation chute, and within there is where the experimentation rooms live. Your job will be to clean and recalibrate each room once experiments have been completed.
character: Okay, well I think that's all for the moment. Don't take too much time mozey-ing around, you've got a job to do!
